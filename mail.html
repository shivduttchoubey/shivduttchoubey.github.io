    Respected Sir,

This mail is intended to follow up on my research topic for NPTEL Internship. I apologize for the delay in sharing this information with you. Developing a detailed plan and selecting the final topic required more time than I initially anticipated.

I have the pleasure of informing you that I have chosen the research topic based upon the inputs gathered from you during the call which were:

1.The research should have some portion of Technical Competence
2.Mathematical Modelling/ Formulation should be seen to provide a tangible and calculated result rather than collection and analysis of publicly available data.

Based upon Healthcare topic, I could find a Bias in Healthcare domain which is "Interpretation Bias". This particular bias can be based upon the following reasons:
a) Personal biases and prejudices
b) Overreliance or under reliance on AI
c) Confirmation bias
d) Contextual factors and other factors

Other topics apart from Interpretation Bias were:
A) Data Bias
B) Algorithmic Bias
C) Representation Bias
D) Accessibility Bias
E) Trust and Adoption Bias
I have attached a PDF Explaining briefly about all the biases mentioned above.


Also, I have chosen another topic as an alternative "CodeScan: An AI-Driven Approach for Detecting Malicious and Vulnerable Code in Third-Party Repositories."

As developers, especially those in the early stages of learning, we often rely on downloading code repositories or copying code snippets from the internet to quickly integrate functionality into projects.<br> However, this practice can inadvertently introduce malware, bugs, or backdoors into the codebase, posing significant security risks.

While secure coding practices are typically taught in software engineering curricula, not all developers are aware of or adhere to these best practices.<br> As a result, they may unknowingly incorporate malicious or faulty code into their projects, leaving them vulnerable to various security threats.

The proposed solution aims to develop an AI algorithm and detection technique that can analyze logs and code repositories, identifying and highlighting problematic portions of the code.<br> By doing so, the solution would provide developers, especially those in the initial learning phase, with a safeguard against the potential risks associated with using unknown or untrusted code sources.

This problem is particularly relevant in the current landscape, where developers are under immense pressure and hurry to build and iterate rapidly, often resorting to integrating third-party code or modules without proper vetting. <br>Addressing this issue would not only protect individual projects but also contribute to the overall security and integrity of the software development ecosystem.

In Addition to this I have completed an NPTEL Course in Ethical Hacking offered by IITKGP which I believe would give additional benefits in this research.

I would be immensely grateful for your feedback and insights to refine this action plan further. <br>Your expertise and guidance will undoubtedly contribute to the success of this internship.

Thank you once again for this invaluable opportunity. I look forward to your response.


Warm Regards,
